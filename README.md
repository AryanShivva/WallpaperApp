* MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) - Our architectural foundation, enabling a modular, efficient, and testable codebase.
<br>

* Coroutines - For asynchronous programming, ensuring smooth performance without blocking the UI thread.
<br>

* ViewModel - To manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, making our app more robust and manageable.
<br>

* Retrofit - Our choice for network calls, thanks to its simplicity and power in handling REST APIs.
<br>

* Glide - For efficient image loading and caching, ensuring our wallpapers look stunning without sacrificing performance.
<br>

* Hilt - For dependency injection, simplifying the code and reducing boilerplate.
